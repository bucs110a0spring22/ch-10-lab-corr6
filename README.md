Replace anything surrounded by the `< >` symbols._

## SUMMARY:
 Updated pre-existing code to have the enemies in the game move around randomly and then added in an extra unique feature.
#### Unique Feature
 Made it so that every time you successfully defeat an enemy, another one spawns. This way there are always three enemies on the screen and the game doesn't end. Code could be updated to see how many enemies you can kill before dying and record a high score.
